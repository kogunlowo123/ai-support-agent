"""Provider abstraction for answer composition.

The application depends on this one protocol and nothing else. Swapping Ollama
for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint is a configuration change; no agent code
moves.

The protocol is asynchronous because every real implementation performs network
I/O, and making the synchronous case async is far cheaper than retrofitting
async later.
